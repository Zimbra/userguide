== Zimbra Mobile App

{product-short} Mobile app gives access to {product-short} email account from phone. It can be used with Zimbra 9 or Zimbra Cloud email account. The app is supported on *Android* and *iOS* based mobile devices. 

Zimbra’s Mobile Apps are created using Apache Cordova. Apache Cordova is an open-source mobile development framework.

Cordova wraps Zimbra’s JavaScript Web app into a native container that can access the device functions of several platforms. These functions are exposed via a unified JavaScript API, allowing Zimbra to write one set of code to target both iOS and Android platforms and publish it to their app stores.

WARNING: The {product-short} Mobile app is supported only on Zimbra 9 and Zimbra Cloud based accounts.

=== Optimization for Mobile Apps

Due to the use of Cordova based technology, most of the functionality implemented on Web App is available on Mobile Apps. The exception being features based on operating systems e.g. notifications. However, keeping in mind the mobile-specific considerations like smaller screen sizes, and lower computing power, some features have been intentionally modified or removed or toned down to provide an optimal mobile collaboration experience. For example:

* The mobile text editor is a plain text editor, instead of a full-fledged rich text editor 
* Mini Calendar is not visible on mobile screens
* When composing an email, users can click a photo and attach it by using the 'Take a photo' option in Attachments.
* Users cannot view a three column view including a preview pane on a mobile screen etc.

=== Upcoming features

Zimbra plans to provide more and more native mobile features for an enhanced mobile user experience. Some of them are:

* Push Notifications.
* Attaching files from mobile local storage.
* Biometric authentication.
* Easy Share.
* Touch Gestures.
