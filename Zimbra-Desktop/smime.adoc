== Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME)

{product-short} Desktop app supports S/MIME functionality. Users can send *Signed* or *Signed and Encrypted* emails to other users. The administrator will have to enable this feature and provide the user's private certificate and recipient's public certificate.

NOTE: S/MIME feature is not available on Mobile App.

NOTE: User can read or send signed and encrypted messages only when the S/MIME feature is enabled. By default the S/MIME feature is disabled for all users.

NOTE: The S/MIME feature available on the Zimbra Desktop app is client-side S/MIME, and the S/MIME feature available on the Modern/Classic Web app is server-side S/MIME. To avoid confusion for end-users, we recommend not to use both of these features together.

=== Encrypted Emails

The *Encrypted* email refers to an email that has been encrypted with a digital certificate.

Encrypting an email helps to protect sensitive data and preserve confidentiality and privacy. This helps in making sure that only the intended recipient can read the email. If the email is intercepted and opened by an unintended user, that user wonâ€™t be able to decrypt and view the email.

For sending encrypted emails, users will need their *Private* certificate and the recipients *Public* certificate.

For reading encrypted emails, users will only need their *Private* certificates.

=== Signed Emails

The *Signed* email refers to an email that has been signed with a digital certificate.

Signing an email helps to:

* Ensure data integrity i.e. the email was not altered from its original form.
* Email authenticity i.e. the email came from an authentic sender.
* Non-repudiation i.e. the signer cannot deny the authenticity of the email.

This helps in knowing that the received email message comes indeed from the declared sender (a warning appears if someone else intercepted and modified the message before it arrived).

For sending signed emails, users will need their *Private* certificate.

For reading signed emails, users will need the recipient's *Public* certificate.

=== Importing certificate

NOTE: In this guide we assume that the users have got the certificate from standard service providers (e.g. Comodo, DigiCert, Go Daddy, etc) whose root CA certificates are already present in browsers.

For easy understanding of the steps, we will refer to following examples throughout the section:

* Sender's private certificate - sender-pvt.p12
* Recipient's public certificate - recipient-pub.crt
