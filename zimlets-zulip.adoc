=== Zulip
Zulip is a group chat app that helps you connect to other users in your organization and quickly initiate conversations. Once your administrator configures Zulip, you can see if other users in your organization are online, launch a private chat with users and connect to public streams.

You will see a list of all the users in the organization on the right side. *Streams* determine who gets a message. *Topics* tell you what the message is about. *Streams* and other messaging options are displayed on the left side. Messages with the same stream and topic are shown together as a conversational thread in the center.
