== Two-factor Authentication
*Two-factor Authentication* (2FA) is a method of confirming your identity by utilizing an information like password and a second factor in the form of a code through Time-based One Time Password (TOTP) apps.
Please visit the wiki for link:https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/TOTPApps[supported apps].

In {product-short}, administrators have the option to enable or enforce Two-factor authentication.

When the Two-factor connection is only enabled, not enforced, you have the option to set it up from <<settings-account.adoc#_two_factor_authentication, Settings -> Accounts>> at your convenience.
In such a case, you can log in with just your username and password.

Below section explains the case when administrator has *enforced* the two-factor authentication for your account.

=== 2FA Enforced
If the administrator has enforced two-factor authentication, you are required to set it up immediately after you log in for the first time.
You cannot use the application until you set up 2FA on your account.

. Launch {product-short}.
. Login using an authorized username and password.
+
NOTE: Since the administrator has enforced two-factor authentication, you immediately reach a page to set up Two-factor Authentication.

. Click *Begin setup*.
. Install an authentication app on your mobile device.
Check https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/TOTPApps[supported apps].
