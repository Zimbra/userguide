=== Zulip
Zulip is a group chat app that helps you connect to other users in your organization and quickly initiate conversations. Once your administrator configures Zulip, you can see if other users in your organization are online, launch a private chat with users and connect to public streams. For more detailed information on Zulipâ€™s features, please refer to https://zulip.com/help/[user documentation].

==== Accessing Zulip Tab

. Click [ *Chat* ] tab.
. Click [ *Zulip* ]

You will see a list of all the users in the organization on the right side. *Streams* determine who gets a message. *Topics* tell you what the message is about. *Streams* and other messaging options are displayed on the left side. Messages with the same stream and topic are shown together as a conversational thread in the center.

==== Checking User Presence and Sending Direct Messages
You can check the active / inactive status of users in your contacts, calendar items, or email conversations. From there, you can easily start a direct message conversation with that user.

. Hover over a name / email in the address bar of a sent or received email message or draft, or in the Invitees section of a calendar item.
. Click on the *Zulip chat* option.

A quick chat window within the {modern-client} will be opened.

NOTE: The quick chat window only supports basic text messages. You can navigate to the Zulip tab for more options like text with rich font, send attachments, start Jitsi video call and view status message set by the users.

==== Checking and Replying Missed Messages

In case of missed messages in chat, an email with subject *Zulip missed messages* is sent. The email will contain the missed chat message and option to *Reply in zulip* at the end of the email.

Clicking on *Reply in zulip* will open chat window in Zulip tab.
