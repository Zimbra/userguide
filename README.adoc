:product-family: Zimbra
:doc-name: {product-family} Administration Guide
:doc-filename: adminguide
:product-version: 8.8.15
:copyright-year: 2019

This repository contains the code necessary to build the {doc-name}.

This guide is for system administrators responsible for installing, maintaining, and supporting the server deployment of {product-family}.

== Images in the Documentation

Any images to be included in the documentation must have their source files stored in the `images` folder, with the following guidelines:

* *Assign a meaningful name:* The name of an image should indicate what the content of the image is.
* *Do not replace images:* Once an image source file has been merged to `develop` or `master` branches of the repository, the image is considered immutable.
If an update or new version of an image is required, then it should be added as a new image with a version number in its name, so it is clear for translators that images have changed. For example, `system-overview.jpg` could be updated with `system-overview-v2.jpg`, with corresponding changes to the file(s) that include the image so they include the new version.
* *Images must render in html & pdf output:* The `asciidoctor-pdf` tool should produce a `pdf` file with your image intact.
If an image does not render, *your PR will be rejected*.
* *Take care with SVG fonts:* link:https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-pdf/#fonts-in-svg-images[If youâ€™re using fonts in your SVG, and you want those fonts to be preserved, those fonts must be defined in the Asciidoctor PDF theme file.]
* *Use "pure" SVGs:* The SVG renderrer used by `asciidoctor-pdf` only supports "pure" SVGs, not the SVG/HTML/CSS hybrid that are sometimes targeted for web viewing.
If your image editor supports export of SVG files without the additional info, use that.
Test your images - a hybrid SVG will render as a black rectangle in `pdf`.

== Building the Documentation

The {doc-name} is written using link:http://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc].
Specifically, it is intended to be processed with link:http://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor].

As a prerequisite to building the documentation, you will need to have already installed and configured link:http://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor].
Check the link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#installation-quick-start[Installation Quick Start] in the link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/[Asciidoctor User Manual] for information on how to get started.

Once you have Asciidoctor installed and working, you can build the documentation into HTML files like so:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
asciidoctor -b html5 -D ~/temp/{product-version} -o {doc-filename}-{product-version}.html index.adoc
----

PDF output can be generated as well:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
asciidoctor-pdf -a allow-uri-read -D ~/temp/{product-version} -o {doc-filename}-{product-version}.pdf index.adoc
----

This assumes you have a "temp" directory to receive the asciidoctor output, and are generating output for version {product-version}... adjust according to your situation.
Each section of the document is contained in its own file. You may use the `index.adoc` file to generate the entire document.

To accompany the HTML output, the `images/` folder must also be copied to the output destination:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
-----
cp -r ./images ~/temp/{product-version}/images
-----

When publishing the output (`gh-pages` branch) the "latest" link needs to be updated to point at the new version:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
-----
ln -nsf {product-version} latest
-----

Finally, the `index.html' file in the root folder needs to be updated to include appropriate links for the new version's documents.
Use your favorite text editor to complete this task before committing and pushing the updated `gh-pages` branch to the repo.

== Localization and translations

=== Source organization

NOTE: The Best Practice for managing translations would be to replace translatable strings in the English `adoc` files with localized strings from language-specific `po` files.
Until that is in place, translated `adoc` source and images are stored in locale-specific folders.

The source repo structure is shown below, and has the following characteristics:

* The top level folder, `{doc-filename}`, contains the US English (`en_us`) documentation source, which is informally designated as the "Master" documentation.
This is where all primary information is authored and updated.
* The Master `settings.adoc` file contains version information for the release, including all translations.
There should be no locale-specific `settings.adoc` files.
* Each locale has its own folder under the "Master", named using the link:https://www.iso.org/iso-639-language-codes.html[ISO-639 Language Code] + link:https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html[ISO-3166 Country Code] to name it.
For example, the Japanese translation appears under `ja_jp`.
* There is a Master `images` folder to be used by all locales, except in the case of translated images.
* Each locale may have its own `images` folder, named using the Language Code + Country Code just like the source folder.
Images take up a lot of space, so translations must not copy all the ones in the Master `images` folder, rather they should be used as-is where feasible.
* If any images *require* translation for a locale, then the translated image should be added to the locale's images folder.
Where translated images are to be embedded, the path to the image will need to explicitly indicate the locale, e.g., `image::ja_jp/images/<image-name.jpg>`.
* The value for `imagesdir` set by `settings.adoc` should be left as-is, pointing at the Master `images` folder.

=== Published doc organization

The documentation output is "published" by being pushed to the `gh-pages` branch, which is automatically hosted as a public website by `GitHub.io`.
Each published release-version of the {doc-name} appears in its own release folder.

Translations of documentation are published under the release-version folders, in a structure that is similar to the source organization.
For example, consider two versions of the {doc-name} with Japanese translations:

         +----+
+--------+    |
|             |
|      /      |

This structure ensures that the relative path to images is the same in both source and published folders, yet the published versions for each release are collected together.

=== Building translations

:locale: ja_jp

Here is an example of building the Japanese documentation:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
asciidoctor -b html5 -D ~/temp/{product-version}/{locale} -o {doc-filename}-{product-version}-{locale}.html {locale}/index.adoc
----

PDF output can be generated as well:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
asciidoctor-pdf -a allow-uri-read -D ~/temp/{product-version}/{locale} -o {doc-filename}-{product-version}-{locale}.pdf index.adoc
----

NOTE: The `asciidoctor-pdf` tool does not support all languages yet, so the PDF output is optional.

The localized `images/` folder must also be copied to the output destination:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
-----
cp -r ./images/{locale} ~/temp/{product-version}/images/{locale}
-----
