== Two-factor Authentication
*Two-factor Authentication* (2FA) is a method of confirming your identity by utilizing an information like password and a second factor in the form of a code through apps like https://authy.com/download/[Authy^(R)^].
In {product-name}, administrators have the option to enable or enforce Two-factor authentication.

Below sections explain both cases -- when two-factor authentication is enforced or only enabled.

=== 2FA Enforced

You cannot use the application until you set up 2FA on your account.
