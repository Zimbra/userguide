== Two-factor Authentication
*Two-factor Authentication* (2FA) is a method of confirming your identity by utilizing an information like password and a second factor in the form of a code through apps like https://authy.com/download/[Authy^(R)^].

In {product-name}, administrators have the option to enable or enforce Two-factor authentication.

Below sections explain both cases -- when two-factor authentication is enforced or only enabled.

=== 2FA Enforced
If the administrator has enforced two-factor authentication, you are required to set it up immediately after you log in for the first time.
You cannot use the application until you set up 2FA on your account.

. Launch {product-name}.
. Login using an authorized username and password.
+
NOTE: Since the administrator has enforced two-factor authentication, you immediately reach a page to set up Two-factor Authentication.

. Click *Begin setup*.
. Install an authentication app on your mobile device.
Check https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/TOTPApps[supported apps].
. Once installed, configure it on your smartphone.
. Click *Next* on the {product-name} screen to begin the process of adding this account to the authentication app.
. On the authenticator app, scan the QR code or enter the code generated on the {product-name} screen.
. Click *Next*. 
. Enter the code generated by your authenticator app and click *Verify* to complete the two-factor authentication setup.
